# ChillX

ChillX is a collection of libraries encapsulating common functionality.
Currently two libraries and tests for each are implemented:
Libraries are Dot Net Standard 2.0 so its usable in both Dot Net Framework and Dot Net Core

- ChillXThreading - Light Weight Multi-Threaded Atomic Unit of Work Processor
- ChillXLogging - Light Weight Offloaded (to separate thread) Asyncronous Logging Framework with automatic capture of unhandled exceptions

# ChillXThreading
This library is a managed Atomic Unit Of Work processor with an auto scaling thread pool designed to support discrete unit of work processor such as API end points. Additionally it implements basic per client concurrent request limits.
Example Use Case:
Implementing API end points in IIS as Web API, MVC etc... is relatively straight forward.
However managing concurrency and backend load etc... are not always as straight forward. While adding a Message Queue is one way of solving this it is also a pretty heavy weight approach to solving this issue.

### Caters for the following requirements:

 - Offloading requests from the web server thread with an Async Await of the processed response
 - Throttling the number of concurrent backend API calls for processing requests
 - Throttling the number of concurrent API calls per client
 - Completes processing of any pending request work items in case of Process Shutdown
 - In the case of Application Pool Recycle completes processing of as many pending request work items until terminated by IIS (Available time window depends on timeout settings in IIS)
 - Gracefull shutdown when Application Pool recycles or when process exists.

### Key features
 - Built for pure performance.
 - Extremely lightweight

### Example Usage

    //Example Usage for WebAPI controller
   public enum WorkItemPriority
    {
        Low = 0,
        Medium = 1,
        High = 2,
    }
    
    private static ThreadedWorkItemProcessor<DummyRequest, DummyResponse, int, WorkItemPriority> ThreadedProcessorExample = new ThreadedWorkItemProcessor<DummyRequest, DummyResponse, int, WorkItemPriority>(
            _maxWorkItemLimitPerClient: 100 // Maximum number of concurrent requests in the processing queue per client. Set to int.MaxValue to disable concurrent request caps
            , _maxWorkerThreads: 16 // Maximum number of threads to scale upto
            , _threadStartupPerWorkItems: 4 // Consider starting a new processing thread ever X requests
            , _threadStartupMinQueueSize: 4 // Do NOT start a new processing thread if work item queue is below this size
            , _idleWorkerThreadExitSeconds: 10 // Idle threads will exit after X seconds
            , _abandonedResponseExpirySeconds: 60 // Expire processed work items after X seconds (Maybe the client terminated or the web request thread died)
            , _processRequestMethod: ProcessRequestMethod // Your Do Work method for processing the request
            , _logErrorMethod: Handler_LogError
            , _logMessageMethod: Handler_LogMessage
            );
    //[FromBody]
    public async Task<DummyResponse> GetResponse([FromBody] DummyRequest _request)
    {
        int clientID = 1; //Replace with the client ID from your authentication mechanism if using per client request caps. Otherwise just hardcode to maybe 0 or whatever
        WorkItemPriority _priority;
        _priority = WorkItemPriority.Medium; //Assign the priority based on whatever prioritization rules.
        int RequestID = ThreadedProcessorExample.ScheduleWorkItem(_priority, _request, clientID);
        if (RequestID < 0)
        {
            //Client has exceeded maximum number of concurrent requests or Application Pool is shutting down
            //return a suitable error message here
            return new DummyResponse() { ErrorMessage = @"Maximum number of concurrent requests exceeded or service is restarting. Please retry request later." };
        }

        //If you need the result (Like in a webapi controller) then do this
        //Otherwise if it is say a backend processing sink where there is no client waiting for a response then we are done here. just return.

        KeyValuePair<bool, ThreadWorkItem<DummyRequest, DummyResponse, int>> workItemResult;

        workItemResult = await ThreadedProcessorExample.TryGetProcessedWorkItemAsync(RequestID,
            _timeoutMS: 1000, //Timeout of 1 second
            _taskWaitType: ThreadProcessorAsyncTaskWaitType.Delay_Specific,
            _delayMS: 10);
        if (!workItemResult.Key)
        {
            //Processing timeout or Application Pool is shutting down
            //return a suitable error message here
            return new DummyResponse() { ErrorMessage = @"Internal system timeout or service is restarting. Please retry request later." };
        }
        return workItemResult.Value.Response;
    }

    public static DummyResponse ProcessRequestMethod(DummyRequest request)
    {
        // Process the request and return the response
        return new DummyResponse() { orderID = request.orderID };
    }
    public static void Handler_LogError(Exception ex)
    {
        //Log unhandled exception here
    }

    public static void Handler_LogMessage(string Message)
    {
        //Log message here
    }

# ChillXLogging
When engineering for performance the last thing we want to do is to tie up application threads in writing log entries. Additionally in the case of concurrent log writes to the same device be it file system or database this can result in lock contentions adding further latency to the application threads.

This library is a light weight, extremely fast logging framework which offloads the actual logging from the application thread to a separate dedicated logging thread. In addition it automatically captures any unhandled exceptions within the process space. calls to the Log method captures the log entry to a queue and immediately returns. The actual log entry is written by a separate dedicated thread via a configurable number of log writers. The library comes with a file system log writer. Adding log writers is trivial. 

### Key Features

 - Lightweight and therefore extremely fast
 - Disconnects the process of submitting a log entry and committing the log entry to storage
 - Convenience extension methods
 - Commits pending log entries in case of Process Shutdown
 - In the case of Application Pool Recycle commits as many pending log entries until terminated by IIS (Available time window depends on timeout settings in IIS)
 - Gracefull shutdown when Application Pool recycles or when process exists.

### Example Usage

    ChillXLogging.Handlers.LogHandlerFile FileLogHandler_RolloverByCount;
    FileLogHandler_RolloverByCount = new ChillXLogging.Handlers.LogHandlerFile(@"C:\Temp\LogTestByCount",
        _fileNamePrepend: @"ByCount_", _fileExtension: @".txt", _fileRollOverPerEntries: 10000, _fileRollOverDays: 99, _fileRollOverHours: 1, _fileRollOverMinutes: 1);

    ChillXLogging.Handlers.LogHandlerFile FileLogHandler_RolloverByTime;
    FileLogHandler_RolloverByTime = new ChillXLogging.Handlers.LogHandlerFile(@"C:\Temp\LogTestByTime",
        _fileNamePrepend: @"ByCount_", _fileExtension: @".txt", _fileRollOverPerEntries: int.MaxValue, _fileRollOverDays: 0, _fileRollOverHours: 0, _fileRollOverMinutes: 1);

    Logger.BatchSize = 100;
    Logger.RegisterHandler(@"RolloverByCount", FileLogHandler_RolloverByCount);
    Logger.RegisterHandler(@"RolloverByTime", FileLogHandler_RolloverByTime);

    //Example usage
    Logger.LogMessage(LogSeverity.info, @"Some message text");
    Logger.LogMessage(LogSeverity.info, @"Some message text", _ex: new Exception(@""), DateTime.Now);
    @"This is a log message".Log(LogSeverity.info);
    LogSeverity.debug.Log(@"This is another log entry");
    LogSeverity.error.Log(@"Lets log a post dated exception", new Exception(@"Some message here"), DateTime.Now.AddHours(8));
    try
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(@"test exception");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        ex.Log(@"This is a test exception", LogSeverity.debug);
        //Supports chaining
        throw ex.Log(@"This is a test exception", LogSeverity.debug).MessageException;
    }
